This tool is a simple proxy server implemented in Python that facilitates communication between a local machine and a remote server. It can listen for incoming connections on a specified local IP and port, forward the data to a remote server, and then relay the response back to the local client.

Key Features:
- Supports command-line arguments to specify local and remote hosts and ports.
- Option to receive data first from the remote server before forwarding to the local client.
- Implements a basic proxy handler that allows for bidirectional communication between local and remote machines.
- Provides functionality for handling and processing data through customizable functions like request_handler and response_handler.
  
Usage Example:
./proxy.py 127.0.0.1 9000 10.12.132.1 9000 True

This would start a proxy server that listens on 127.0.0.1:9000, forwards data to 10.12.132.1:9000, and receives data from the remote server first before sending it to the local client.
